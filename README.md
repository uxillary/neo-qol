# NeoQOL: Quality of Life Scripts for Neopets
## Enhance Your Neopets Experience

### Disclaimer
All scripts have been developed with caution to stay within the parameters set by The Neopets Team (TNT) policies and guidelines. While scripting remains a contested topic within the Neopets community, we've strived to ensure compliance. **Use these scripts at your own risk** â€” personally, I wouldn't use these on a main account, it's not worth the risk. I really just scripted these for fun.
