# NeoQOL: Quality of Life Scripts for Neopets
## Enhance Your Neopets Experience

### Disclaimer
All scripts have been developed with caution to stay within the parameters set by The Neopets Team (TNT) policies and guidelines. While scripting remains a contested topic within the Neopets community, we've strived to ensure compliance. Personally, I wouldn't use these scripts on a main account, it's not worth the risk.

> [!CAUTION]
>Use these scripts at your own risk.

### Helpful Resources

## Shop [obj #] Item Highlighter
This script highlights items in Shops based on their price categories, making it easier to restock and spot valuable items quickly. The script uses predefined price ranges to apply different styles to items, such as color-coding and borders.

### Features
- **Price Key**: A floating price key on the right side of the screen shows the color codes for different price ranges.
- **Visual Highlights**: Items are color-coded and highlighted based on their price, with subtler items having light grey colors and more expensive ones having bold red borders.

### How to Use
- Install the Script: Download the script and add it to your preferred user script manager such as Tampermonkey.
- Shop Page Matching: The script automatically runs when you visit the Shop page **(/objects.phtml?obj_type=`20`&type=shop)**
### The script highlights items under the following categories:
- ðŸŸ¦ **< 700 NP**  
- ðŸŸ¨ **700 - 1,900 NP**  
- ðŸŸ© **1,900 - 4,500 NP**  
- ðŸŸ§ **4,500 - 40,000 NP**  
- ðŸŸ¥ **40,000 NP +**

## How to Update Item Lists:
To ensure the correct items are highlighted, follow these steps to manually obtain the latest item price lists from Jellyneo. Also, if you want to use this script template and add a different shop.

- Search Items: Visit Jellyneoâ€™s Item Database and search for the desired shop items.
> [Example Search Term](https://items.jellyneo.net/search/?name_type=2&cat[]=11&min_rarity=0&max_rarity=100&min_price=40000&sort=5&sort_dir=desc&limit=75) for Spooky Food (obj 30)
- Filter by Price: Sort the items by price to find those that fall into the desired price categories.
- Install the "JN Item Name Extractor" script to Tampermonkey, found above.
> [!NOTE]
> This script is compliant with JN's Scraping Policy.
- Copy item names: Copy the item names using the copy button provided by the JN script.
- Update the Shop Script: Paste the item names into their respective lists in the script and save it.
- Some items cost more than the SW/ JN price - just remove these as you go, and save.
