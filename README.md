# NeoQOL: Quality of Life Scripts for Neopets
## Enhance Your Neopets Experience

### Disclaimer
All scripts have been developed with utmost caution to stay within the parameters set by The Neopets Team (TNT) policies and guidelines. While scripting remains a contested topic within the Neopets community, we've strived to ensure compliance. **Use these scripts at your own risk**—personally, I refrain from using them on my main account. These are, for me, a playground to hone my coding skills.
